    <p><u><h3>Description</h3></u></p> 
    <p>Fundamentals of electric circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting and easier to understand than other more traditional texts. Students are introduced to the sound six-step problem solving methodology in Chapter one and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text. A balance of theory, worked extended examples, practice problems and real-world applications combined with over 468 new or changed homework problems complete this edition. This book retains the "design a problem" Feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question as well as the solution.
    <br><b>Salient Features:</b><ul>
        <li>More than 2400 Problems provided in this text with over 450 new homework problems </li>
        <li>Includes 121 "Design a Problem" Exercises</li>
        <li>The Six-step problem solving methodology supplements to promote sound problem-solving practices</li>
